START

1. Initialize global variables:
   - shoppingCart: an array to store the items added to the cart
   - totalPrice: to keep track of the total price of items in the cart
   - averagePrice: to calculate the average price of items in the cart

2. Define functions:

   2.1. openTab(tabName):
       - When a tab is clicked, this function switches between product categories.
       - Remove 'active-link' class from all tabs.
       - Add 'active-link' class to the clicked tab.
       - Hide all product sections.
       - Show the corresponding product section.

   2.2. addToCart(item):
       - Add the selected item to the shoppingCart array.
       - Update the cart display.

   2.3. removeFromCart(index):
       - Remove the item at the specified index from the shoppingCart array.
       - Update the cart display.

   2.4. updateCart():
       - Update the cart display with the current contents of the shoppingCart array.
       - Calculate the total price and average price of items in the cart.
       - Display the total amount and average amount in the cart summary.

   2.5. initializePage():
       - Attach event listeners to tabs to switch between product categories.
       - Fetch and display initial product data.
       - Call the updateCart function to initialize the cart display.

3. HTML Structure:
   - Create a main container with two sections: side-bar and bg-container.
   - Inside the side-bar, create tabs for different categories and price ranges.
   - Inside the bg-container, display product sections for Men, Women, and Kids.
   - Include a cart section to display added items and cart summary.

4. CSS Styling:
   - Style the layout using Flexbox for the main container.
   - Apply appropriate styling for the side-bar, tabs, product cards, and cart sections.
   - Use media queries for responsiveness.

5. JavaScript Integration:
   - Integrate the defined JavaScript functions into the script.js file.
   - Attach event listeners to tabs for switching between product categories.
   - Fetch product data from a JSON file using the Fetch API.
   - Display product cards based on the fetched data.
   - Implement functionality to add items to the cart and update the cart display accordingly.

6. Initialization:
   - Call the initializePage function when the page loads to set up the initial state of the page.

7. Additional Considerations:
   - Handle product images, additional product details, and overall design enhancements.
   - Implement functionality to filter products based on price ranges.
   - Refine the cart summary and consider additional features like delivery charges.
   - Ensure error handling and optimize the user interface based on requirements.
